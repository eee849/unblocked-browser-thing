## Reporting a Vulnerability

There are probably many vulnerabilities within this- and if there are, whether the scale or not, I do want to know of them.
A vulnerability in this case is: 
A CRITICAL OVERSIGHT that allows for personal info/info from the host the VNC is running on to be taken
Any kind of remote connection that is not supposed to be port forwarded that is potentially running background processes I did not add.
Any kind of malware or critical oversight I do want though, so for anything else, use your own judgement; but please tell me if there is something terribly wrong with what I have made in terms of security!
