# Unblocked Browser Thing
A little thing i made for myself- praying i can host it

## Installation

Run run.py which should auto install all dependents and then start the port forwarding.

### Important info

After the run was successful, open port 6080 in your web browser from "Ports" in VScode or Codespaces. This should show you a list of files, and you want to click something like nvnc.html, not nvnc-lite.html.

IF RESIZING PROBLEMS OCCUR GO TO SETTINGS AND SELECT LOCAL SCALING INSTEAD OF REMOTE.

### Prerequisites

Selenium
```bash
pip install selenium
```
but you should not have to run the prerequisites manually, it should auto install as soon as you run run.py (LINUX ONLY)
this will not work on windows, potentially could work on mac though
do not run themain.py, run run.py as that will start all the ports and install all prerequisites and then run themain.py for you

## Usage

Used as a unblocked browser for schools.
