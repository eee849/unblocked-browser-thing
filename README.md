# Unblocked Browser Thing
A little thing i made for myself- praying i can host it

## Installation

I'm not sure if you can or not.

### Prerequisites

Selenium
```bash
pip install selenium
```
but you should not have to run the prerequisites manually, it should auto install as soon as you run run.py (LINUX ONLY)
this will not work on windows, potentially could work on mac though

## Usage

Used as a unblocked browser for schools.
