# Unblocked Browser/OS Thing
A little thing i made for myself- praying i can host it

## Installation

Run 
```bash
docker build -t void-desktop .
```

### Important info

After the run was successful, open port 6080 in your web browser from "Ports" in VScode or Codespaces. This should show you a list of files, or automatically go to the novnc client. If it does show a list of files, you want to click something like nvnc.html, not nvnc-lite.html.

IF RESIZING PROBLEMS OCCUR GO TO SETTINGS AND SELECT LOCAL SCALING INSTEAD OF REMOTE.

### Prerequisites

Docker
```bash
sudo apt install docker
```
Use docker to build void-desktop

## Usage

Used as a unblocked OS/Browser for schools.



## Technologies

* Github Codespaces
